# This is a resubmission: 

I've: 

- I've written package and libraries names and in undirected single quotes in title and description in the DESCRIPTION file. See: 'Animate.css', 'rmarkdown', 'shiny' 

- I've respected the exact names of packages: shiny, rmarkdown (as they're case sensitive)

- I've replaced the \dontrun{} examples to \donttest{} examples. 

- I've used the use_gomo() function inside the example of gomo_gomo_no() as suggested. 


Thank you again for your comments.
